    "## Use spatial indexing to query spatial data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to work with the spatio-temporal library that is pre-installed on all Spark environments in Watson Studio. The spatio-temporal library supports spatial indexing functions which you will learn to use in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial indexing functions enable efficient access to simple geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons in spatial databases. These functions greatly enhance time-critical search of spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the spatial indexing functionality in spatial databases like Db2 Spatial, Oracle Spatial, or Microsoft SQL Server Spatial is not accessible. However, with the spatial indexing support in the spatio-temporal library you can now index and query arbitrary geometries. The spatial indices support various queries, which you will learn to use in this notebook, including: \n",
    "- `containing`\n",
    "- `within_distance`\n",
    "- `intersects`\n",
    "\n",
    "The time taken to search for geometries in a database can decrease significantly depending on the size and complexity of the geometries. For example, you can query which ZIP code a polygon belongs to by entering a single point. A sequential search across the polygons would be very slow and expensive; however searching a spatial index of all ZIP code polygons for a country answers this query significantly faster.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several options available to choose from for spatial indexing, which include **grid_index**, **r_star_tree_index** and **tessellation_index**. Click the following links for a quick introduction about each of these indexes:\n",
    "1. [Grid index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(spatial_index))\n",
    "2. [R* tree index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree)\n",
    "3. [Tessellation index](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10095020.2016.1146440) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: this tessellation index is not a  standard tessellation index. Instead, it is similar to a grid index, only in this case the grid is uniform with respect to the _size_ (in meters) of the grid, as opposed to a typical grid index that is uniform with respect to the number of latitude/longitude divisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will use the tessellation index. To create a tessellation spatial index, you need to set the following two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bounding box**: Defines the boundary of the spatial index. If you know exactly where your geometries are and can  define a boundary that contains all these geometries, you should provide his bounding box information to the method because it will reduce the amount of \"tiles\" that need to be created and thus increase performance. However, if you don't know much about the geometries or you want to play safe and not exclude any geometry, that might potentially fall out of the given bounding box (both are very common situations), you can use the whole earth as the bounding box by simply leave the `bbox parameter` parameter value set  to `None`, which is the default value.\n",
    "- **Tile size**: Tile size is the size of the tile in the tessellation index. The value is given by the length of the tile in the unit of `meters`. You should provide a tile size that is close to the size of your geometries for better performance. For example,  if your geometries are $ 100km^2 (i.e. 10^8 m^2)$ then $ 10^4m$ could be a good value for tile size.\n",
    "\n",
    "After deciding the bounding box and tile size, you can create the spatial index and import your geometries into the spatial index. For this you will use the `from_df` method which puts the geometries in a pandas DataFrame into the spatial index. You only need to specify the name of the geometry ID column and the name of the geometry column. The extra parameter called verbosity, which controls how many processing logs to print out, can be set to `error` which allows only summary and failure entries to display."
