    "IBM Federated Learning enables you to train a machine learning model across multiple decentralized parties holding local data sets, without sharing the local data sets. Such parties can be for example within an enterprise, within a consortium of enterprises, within multiple data centers or multiple clouds, or on edge devices. This allows to build a collective machine learning model without sharing data between the nodes, therefore addressing data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance requirements, as well as eliminating data movement and its associated costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the federated learning training process, the parties build locally trained machine learning models and send these local models to an aggregator. The aggregator fuses the local models into an aggregated model and sends this model back to the parties to continue with the next round of training.\n",

    "IBM Federated Learning uses SSL secured connections between the parties and the aggregator for communicating the machine learning models. In this setting, the aggregator can still see the unencrypted local and aggregated models. \n",
    "\n",
    "IBM Federated Learning further includes homomorphic encryption capabilities, to enhance the parties’ data privacy and security in settings where the aggregator operates in an environment which is less trusted, and the parties wish to avoid revealing the local models and the aggregated models to the aggregator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a form of encryption that enables performing computations on the encrypted data without decrypting it. The results of the computations remain in encrypted form which, when decrypted, results in an output that is the same as the output produced had the computations been performed on the unencrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In federated learning, homomorphic encryption enables the parties to homomorphically encrypt their local model updates before sending them to the aggregator. The aggregator sees only the homomorphically encrypted local model updates, and therefore cannot learn anything from this information. Specifically, the aggregator is not able to reverse-engineer the local model updates to discover information on local training data. The aggregator fuses the local model updates in their encrypted form, obtaining an encrypted aggregated model. Then the aggregator sends the encrypted aggregated model to the parties, which decrypt it and continue with the next round of training.\n",

Each party encrypts its local model update using the public HE key, and sends its encrypted local model update to the aggregator. Since the aggregator does not have the private HE key, it cannot decrypt the encrypted local model updates.\n",

The security level corresponds to the strength of the encryption system, typically measured by the number of operations that an attacker must perform to break the system. The precision level corresponds to the precision of the encryption system's outcomes. Higher precision level means that cryptographic operations are accurate up to a larger number of digits before and after the floating point. Higher precision levels reduce loss of accuracy of the model due to the encryption operations.  \n",
