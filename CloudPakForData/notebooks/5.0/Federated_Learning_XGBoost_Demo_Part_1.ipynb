This allows enterprises to train data with other companies without delegating resources for security. Another advantage is the remote data does not have to be centralized in one location, eliminates the needs to move potentially large datasets. This notebook demonstrates how to start Federated Learning with the Python client. For more details setting up Federated Learning, terminology, and running Federated Learning from the UI, see [Federated Learning documentation](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fed-lea.html?audience=wdp).\n","\n","### Learning Goals\n","\n","When you complete the Part 1 - WML Federated Learning with XGBoost and Adult Income dataset - Aggregator notebook, you should know how to:\n","\n","- Create a Remote Training System\n","- Start a training job\n","\n","Once you complete this notebook, please open [Part 2 - WML Federated Learning with XGBoost and Adult Income dataset - Party](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/).
