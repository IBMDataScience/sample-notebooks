    "The fundamental data structure underlying this optimization problem is the *simplex tableau*, which consists of the coefficient matrix $a_{ij}$, the cost and right-hand side (*rhs*) vectors $c_{j}$ and $b_{i}$, and the lower and upper bound vectors $l_{j}$ and $u_{j}$. In most real world applications of decision optimization, the tableau is very sparse; that is, very few of its coefficients are non-zero, often fewer than 1%. The algorithms for solving the optimization are especially structured to take advantage of this sparsity. Thus, only entries for which $a_{ij}≠0$ are explicitly represented. Ordinarily, the indices $i$ and $j$ are taken to be integers and the index sets $I$ and $J$ are taken to be sets of integers. This paper will call this formulation the *tableau* representation, in homage to George Dantzig, the inventor of linear programming and the Simplex algorithm for solving them. (See [References](#References) below. Dantzig himself credits the economist Quesnay with coining the term *tableau* in his 1759 book.) In this case, the transformation of the model into the internal matrix representation for the solver is straightforward; each index $j$ corresponds to a column and each $i$ corresponds to a row. However, integer indexing is often too restrictive in real-world optimization problems. Most large optimization models have a great deal of structure, with multiple classes of decision variables and constraints, each of which has its own indexing scheme. The modeling layer then needs to handle the mapping between the index sets and the rows and columns of the tableau representation."

    "Authors of optimization models have long recognized the value of using a more general formulation of an optimization problem. In the more general representation, the indices *i* and *j* are taken to be tuples. A *tuple* is multicomponent data structure where each component, or *field*, is a simple data type, such as an integer or a character string. A subset of the fields of the tuple that uniquely identifies it is called the *key*; the data in the key fields must be discrete. The data in the non-key fields, on the other hand, may be continuous, e.g. a floating point number. (Note that, while there are similarities between the tuples discussed in this paper and the similarly named Python objects, it is important that they remain distinct.) Here is an example of a tuple that might arise in a network flow optimization:"

    "A consumer packaged goods supplier needs to decide where to locate its warehouses to serve a set of retail stores at different locations. At the same time, it also needs to determine how much capacity each warehouse should have. The cost of opening a warehouse has a fixed component, related to the acquisition of land and designing the facility, and a variable component proportional to the capacity of the warehouse. The cost to ship the goods from a warehouse to a store depends on the distance between them. The objective is to minimize the cost of opening the warehouses and shipping the goods. Such an optimization application would typically be used as part of an annual planning process in which the company’s management would decide on sales targets and the capital investments needed to support them."

A tuple set in OPL corresponds to a table in a relational database. A tuple in OPL corresponds to a row, or record, in a database table. A data set, or *collector*, for an optimization model consists of one or more tables (tuple sets), usually having foreign keys that link them together. "

This relationship, in turn, implies that the common operations on relational data, namely *selects* and *joins*, can also be used to transform the data used in optimization modeling. Since relational database systems are designed to execute these operations very efficiently on very large datasets, using such a system as the basis for optimization modeling can have very great advantages in speed and efficiency. Not all of the latency in solving an optimization problem is due to the computational algorithms; many times, the upstream and downstream data transformations contribute significantly as well."

While an RDD does not have to have a relational structure, for the purposes of this paper, relational structure will be assumed. A Spark RDD with a relational structure is called a *dataset* (or *dataframe* in Python)."
