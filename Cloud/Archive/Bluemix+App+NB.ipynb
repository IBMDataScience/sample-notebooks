    "IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to achieve insights. Data scientists can use the best of open source, tap into IBM's unique features, grow their skills, and collaborate with teams. \n",
    "One of the many features of DSX provides the capability to create and train a machine learning model in DSX with little to no coding. This model can subsequently be saved and deployed to Watson Machine Learning on IBM Bluemix and called for scoring in real-time. \n",
    "This tutorial is a continuation of the logistic regression analysis tutorial at: \n",
    "https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-example-log-regress.html \n",
    "which creates, trains, saves and deploys a logistic regression model that predicts the possibility for a tent purchase based on age, sex, marital status and job profession for an individual. In this tutorial, a very simple Python Flask web application front end will be created to call this deployed model in real time. \n",

The following techniques can also be applied to other web app frameworks. For this tutorial, a boilerplate Python Flask web app will be created on Bluemix and the supporting files will be downloaded.  These files will be updated to integrate with your model and then pushed back up.\n",

To access this web app, click on the **Visit App URL** link.  The URL to access this Web application will be: `http://<your_app_name>.mybluemix.net` \n",

    "4. Now this boilerplate Python Flask Web application will be updated to call the deployed logistic regression model above. \n",
    "5. In the folder where the unpacked starter code is located, create a file called `MLTutorial.py` and copy the following Python code into that file. As before, update the `url`, `username`, `password`, and `scoring_endpoint` fields to match with your deployed model. You may need to set pasting options to preserve the indentations which are critical for the following Python code. When completed, save this file.
