    "<b>Vincent Beraudier</b> is Software Architect and Program Manager for Prescriptive Analytics and Decision Optimization in IBM Analytics. With IBM and ILOG for more than 16 years, he has been responsible for optimization model development tools: OPL and DOcplex. OPL, the Optimization Programming Language, provides a natural mathematical description of optimization models. DOcplex, IBM's CPLEX modeling for Python offering, is an open source project that aims at leveraging the scientific ecosystem of Python and Jupyter/Zeppeling Notebooks. It can solve Optimization Mathematical Programming models with CPLEX cloud service (DOcplexcloud) or with CPLEX local solver, without any code change."
