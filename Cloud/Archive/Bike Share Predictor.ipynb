    "# Model bike sharing data with SPSS\n",
    "This Scala 2.10 notebook shows you how to create a predictive model of bike sharing trends by using IBM SPSS Algorithms on Apache Spark. You'll learn how to create a generalized linear model with the SPSS ML API, and how to view the model with the SPSS Model Viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generalized linear model (GLM) is an analytical algorithm for different types of data. It includes statistical models such as linear regression for normally distributed targets, logistic models for binary or multinomial targets, and log linear models for count data. In addition to building a model, the GLM provides features such as variable selection, automatic selection of the distribution and link function, and model evaluation statistics. The GLM has options for regularization, such as LASSO, ridge regression, and elastic net, and can handle a wide variety of data.\n",

    "The bike sharing model will:\n",
