    "In this notebook, I walk through a predictive maintenance problem in great detail.  These types of issues can be tricky for several reasons.  The first six sections deal with building a model.  The last sections deal with evaluating model effectiveness and ensuring it will be effective when deployed in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to dealing with machines that require periodic maintenance, there are generally three possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One, you can maintain a machine too frequently. In other words, the machine gets maintenance when it is not required. In this scenario, you are throwing money out the window, wasting resources providing unnecessary maintenance. For example, you could change the oil in your car every single day. This is not optimal, and you will waste a lot of money on unnecessary maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two, you don’t maintain your machine frequently enough. Failing to maintain a machine means that the machine will break while operating. Here, the costs could be substantial. Not only do you have the repair costs, but also costs associated with lost production. If a machine on the assembly line goes down, the line cannot produce anything. No production means lost profit. Also, you will incur legal and medical costs if injuries occurred as a result of the failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three, a machine is maintained when it needs maintenance. This is obviously the better alternative of the three. Note, that that there is still a cost associated with timely maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need to maintain machines when they need maintenance, right? Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Fortunately, we can use predictive maintenance (PM) to predict when machines need maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should also mention that most machines come with manufacturer recommendations on maintenance. The problem with manufacturer recommendations is that they represent an average. For example, cars on average need an oil change every 3,000 miles, but how frequently does your car need an oil change? It may be more or less than 3,000 miles depending on several factors, including where your drive, how you drive, and how frequently you drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive maintenance (PM) can tell you, based on data, when a machine requires maintenance. An effective PM program will minimize under and over-maintaining your machine. For a large manufacturer with thousands of machines, being precise on machine maintenance can save millions of dollars every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will examine a typical Predictive Maintenance (PM) use case. As I walk through this example, I will describe some of the issues that arise with PM problems and suggest ways to solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about the data used in this exercise. It is entirely fake. I created the data based on my experience of dealing with these types of problems. Although it is entirely artificial, I believe the data and use case is very realistic and consistent with many real PM problems.\n",

    "From the data above, it currently costs the firm about $28,000 per failed or maintained machine. Our goal is to lower this cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chart above, Timely Maintenance costs more than Unnecessary Maintenance. There is a good reason for this. For this machine, unnecessary maintenance means that that machine was moved off-line and checked, but the part in question showed insufficient wear to replace. Because parts were not replaced, there are no material costs, only labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this company does very little predictive maintenance. Most of the time, they just run the machines to failure. Also, note that these machines will break in four to eight years if they don’t receive maintenance. When they fail, they must be pulled off-line and repaired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to show the firm how a Predictive Maintenance program can save them money. To do this, we will build a predictive model that predicts machine failure within 90 days of actual failure. Note that an appropriate failure window will always depend on the context of the problem. If a machine breaks without maintenance in 6 months, a three-month window makes no sense. Here, where a machine will run between 4 to 6 years without maintenance, a 90-day window is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to develop a solution that will lower the costs of failure. Again, it currently costs the firm about 28,000 per machine. We will attempt to reduce this cost.\n",

    "These results are not bad, but there are a few issues.  Balancing the data significantly alters your base probability of failure.  Remember, before we applied the SMOTE algorithm, about 3.8% of our records were labeled as a FAILURE_TARGET.  After using the SMOTE algorithm, 50% were failures.  Because of this, I always prefer to evaluate the model on the unbalanced data.  Below we will examine the unbalanced data with a 50% cut-off.\n",

    "Also, note that the predicted probability from our model is based on the balanced data.  This means it is not the true probability of failure.  The true probability of failure will be closer to .14%, not 50%.  The .14% comes from an average of the original failure variable. (EQUIPMENT_FAILURE).  \n",
    "\n",
    "I am using the term \"probability,\" perhaps a little too loosely in this article.  Just understand that the probability that the equipment will fail in the real world is about .14% (based on EQUIPMENT_FAILURE).  The likelihood of selecting a day within 28 days of a failure (FAILURE_TARGET) is about 3.8%.  The probability of a failure after we balance the data is 50%.\n",
