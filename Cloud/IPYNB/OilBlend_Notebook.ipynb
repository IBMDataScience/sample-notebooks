It takes into account specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \n",

Organizations that can act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.  \n",

For example, increase the number of oil types, or change the initial cost of the fuel, then rerun the methods to present a different picture.\n",
