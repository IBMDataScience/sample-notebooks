The algorithm tries to find patterns in a sample of **training data** that can be used on future data. The model itself is a summary of these patterns, distilled into mathematical relationships between variables. The algorithm depends on **hyperparameters** that control how it looks for these patterns (that is, how it learns). \n\nThe difficult part is to find parameters that balance accuracy and precision of the model with its ability to generalize.\n\n**Note:**\n* Accuracy and precision of predictions depend on the complexity of the model\n* Ability to generalize depends on how conservative the model is (how quickly it concludes that something is a pattern)\n\nThis balancing act is called the **bias-variance tradeoff**, because a very complex model will represent all the specific nuances of its training data, therefore failing to generalize. In the opposite case, a simple model does not pick up enough of a pattern to ensure accuracy and precision of future predictions. \n\nYour job* is to pick an efficient algorithm and suitable model for our data set and learning task, and fine-tune its parameters to produce a balanced model.\n\n**apart from the arduous task of data pre-processing, which this notebook skims over for the sake of brevity (and sanity!)*\n\n\n### 1.2 Defining the task<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-3\"></a>\n\nThe goal is to use an augmented version <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this data set</a> to develop a predictive model which classifies breast tumors as malignant or benign depending on measurements of the tumor cells.

In machine learning terms, the **target** (what you want to predict) is the diagnosis, and the **features** are the measurements. The data sample contains **observations** of tumor cases described by these two components.\n\n\n### 1.3 How does an algorithm learn?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-4\"></a>\n\n1. Initialize the algorithm to produce a default model, and give it the feature data. The algorithm makes its first set of predictions (close to a random guess).\n2. The algorithm measures the error between its previous prediction and the true value of the targets. \n3. The algorithm adjusts its model-building to make the error smaller. Each adjustment represents a part of the pattern it is learning, and is used to process future data.\n4. It continues to predict, calculate error, and adjust.\n\nRemember that the algorithm is only using a training sample to perform step 3. If the algorithm makes an adjustment so that its predictions are *exactly* the targets, then it is **overfitted** to the training data. This means that it has lost the ability to generalize to new (unseen) observations, because it picked up a pattern that only applies to the data points it learned from.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### Load data\nTo load the data:\n1.

Initialize the algorithm to produce a default model, and give it the feature data. The algorithm makes its first set of predictions (close to a random guess).*<br/>\nThe default model is the very first splitting feature - the algorithm chose 'concave points mean <= 0.0492'. The observations are divided into benign or malignant based on this decision, making up the first set of predictions!\n\n*2. The algorithm measures the error between its previous prediction and the true value of the targets.*<br/> \nThis error is quantified by the gini value that appears in the first node of the tree.\n\n*3. The algorithm adjusts its model-building to make the error smaller. Each adjustment represents a part of the pattern it is learning, and is used to process future data.*<br/>\nThe adjustment is the next splitting feature that is chosen for each subgroup that resulted from the concave points mean decision. The algorithm chose 'radius worst' for observations that had a concave points mean less than the threshold, and 'concavity worst' for observations with concave points mean greater than the threshold.\n\n*4. It continues to predict, calculate error, and adjust.*<br/>\nThe next set of predictions are the classifications that result from the second round of decision making. Each time, a gini value is calculated to indicate how far the classifications are from the true targets, and another set of splitting features are chosen to further refine the class groupings. \n\n### 2.4 Evaluating the model<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-12\"></a>\nPick a metric to measure predictive accuracy or performance of your model, so that you can compare different models. \n\nModels can differ in two ways:\n\n1. The algorithm used for learning (for example, the difference between a decision tree and gradient boosting)\n2. The **parameter** selection within a single algorithm (for example, a model with a learning rate set to 0.1 or 0.0)\n\nThis case refers to (1), you want to know how the tree model performs, so that it can be compared to the gradient boosting model in the next section.\n\nThe choice of evaluation metric depends on the type of learning problem. For binary classification, you can use a metric called the <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Machine-Learning-What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-AUC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AUC score</a>, which measures the probability that the model correctly identifies *malignant tumors only*. This metric is used as an indication of performance because misclassifying a malignant tumor as benign is the worst prediction scenario (compared to correct classification of benign/malignant and misclassification of benign).\n\nYou also calculate the general accuracy of the model - the percentage of observations that have been correctly classified overall. The following code uses your simple tree model to predict on the testing set, and evaluates the accuracy and AUC score of its predictions:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from sklearn import metrics\n\n#Predict test set:\ntest_predictions = tree_model.predict(X_test[splitting_features])\ntest_predprob = tree_model.predict_proba(X_test[splitting_features])[:,1]\n        \n#Print model report:\nprint(\"Accuracy : %.4g\" % metrics.accuracy_score(y_test['diagnosis'].values, test_predictions))\nprint(\"AUC Score: %f\" % metrics.roc_auc_score(y_test['diagnosis'], test_predprob))", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The model gives ~94% accuracy for all cases, and a ~94% probability of catching malignant cases in the data.

A tree is used to learn from the data as described in [section 2.2](#bullet-10). This first model is called the **base learner**.\n2. The algorithm calculates the error of the base learner's final predictions. These error measurements are called **pseudo-residuals**. \n3. A second decision tree, called the **booster**, is stacked on top of the base tree by using the pseudo-residuals as input. Its output is a prediction of error for each prediction of the base tree. \n4. The algorithm adjusts the base prediction by adding the predicted amount of error.\n*Note: target - prediction = error, so by adding 'predicted error' to the base prediction, you are getting closer to the target.*\n5. Another set of pseudo-residuals are calculated for the predictions of the updated model (base tree + first boosting tree). Each round of boosting corrects the base prediction by a predicted amount of error, gradually inching towards the true value.\n\n\n### 3.2 XGBoost<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-15\"></a>\n\nYou use the XGBoost library, an implementation of gradient tree boosting popularized by usage in machine learning competitions.

You use 5 subsamples: you can call them A, B, C, D, E.\n2. The model is trained on 4 subsamples (for example, A, B, C, D).\n3. The model makes predictions on the subsample that was held out from training (E), and you score it based on an evaluation metric.\n4. The model is then trained on another combination of subsamples (for example, B, C, D, E), and tested on the one that was held out (A).\n5. This repeats for every possible combination of k-folds.

The selection here depends on the nature of your data and your experience. Recall that parameters tell the algorithm how to learn in one of two ways: how complex the model will be, and how quickly it should conclude on a pattern in the data.\n\nLuckily, XGBoost performs well with its default values, so you only need to define the following three parameters: \n\n1. objective: Depends on the target type - use binary:logistic because you have a binary classification problem.\n2. learning rate: This parameter is always chosen first, as the optimal values of all other parameters are dependent upon it. It directly controls how conservative the model is in picking up patterns - a smaller value makes the model more conservative. A good rule of thumb is to initialize the learning rate at 0.1.  \n3. number of estimators: The maximum number of boosting trees to be added. Pick a number that is a bit larger than necessary for our data set size. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# initializing our first model with an objective and learning rate\nxgb0 = XGBClassifier(\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n learning_rate = 0.1, \n n_estimators = 30)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 4.2 Tuning number of estimators<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-19\"></a>\n\nThe 'number of estimators' parameter in XGBoost refers to the maximum number of boosting trees (or rounds) to be used in building the model. Intuitively, the more trees that are added to the model, the more complex it is. This parameter is tuned first, so you can broadly adjust the complexity of your model before making adjustments that have smaller impacts on conservative learning.\n\nThe function below performs the following actions to find the best number of boosting trees to use on your data:\n\n1. Trains an XGBoost model using features of the data.\n2. Performs k-fold cross validation on the model, using accuracy and AUC score as the evaluation metric.\n3.
