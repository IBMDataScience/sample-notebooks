    "This strategy is known as cyclic block coordinate descent or the non-linear Gauss-Seidel method. \n",
    "Whereas $Q$ is non-convex in  $\\vf_i,\\vf_u$, $Q$ is convex in  $\\vf_i$ (with  $\\vf_u$ fixed) and convex in  $\\vf_u$ (with $\\vf_i$ fixed). \n",
    "Therefore, a solution to the subproblems of minimizing $Q$ with fixed $\\vf_i$ and minimizing $Q$ with fixed $\\vf_u$ can be found, e.g., via gradient descent or Newton's method. \n",
    "As this optimization problem is non-convex, one cannot in general guarantee convergence to a global minimum; however, convergence to a stationary point can be ensured. \n",
    "Specifically, provided that $\\lambda > 0$, $Q$ is strongly convex in  $\\vf_i$ (with  $\\vf_u$ fixed) and in $\\vf_u$ (with $\\vf_i$ fixed). \n",
    "Thus, the subproblems have unique solutions, and therefore, if we solve each subproblem exactly, convergence to a stationary point is ensured.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as noted in the context of matrix factorization, solving the subproblems exactly may slow down convergence. \n",
    "Specifically, when $\\vf_u,\\vf_i$ are far from a stationary point, it is intuitive that there is little reason to allocate computational resources to solve the subproblems exactly. \n",
    "It is therefore often more efficient to solve the subproblem only approximately in each iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the above reasons, we will only approximately solve each subproblem by using a single step of projected gradient descent with backtracking line search, and iteratively update $\\vf_i$ and $\\vf_u$ by single projected gradient descent steps until convergence. Convergence is declared if $Q$ stops decreasing. This results in a very efficient algorithm that is essentially linear in the number of positive examples $\\{(u,i)\\colon r_{ui} = 1\\}$, and the number of co-clusters $K$. Our simulations have shown that performing only one gradient descent step significantly speeds up the algorithm. "

The second part showed you how to prepare your data so you can use the `OCuLaR` algorithms to create recommendations and evaluate its performance using recall. You can now apply this to your own data sets and get recommendations with the `OCuLaR` algorithm."
