    "The [Unit Commitment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_commitment_problem_in_electrical_power_production) is a *\"family of problems where the production of a set of electrical generators is coordinated in order to achieve some common target, usually either to match the energy demand at minimum cost or to maximize revenues from energy production\"*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The input of the problem is made of :\n",
    "* some **known data**, such as the characteristics of the generators (minimum and maximum capacity, ramp-up and down capacity (how much more or less the generator can produce from one period to the next), availability, fixed cost of operating the generator, variable cost of producing one unit of electricy per period, etc.).\n",
    "* some **uncertain data**, such as the electricity demand or the wind power generation, which is predicted using predictive models trained with historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unit Commitment Problem answers the question \"Which power generators should I run at which periods and at what level in order to satisfy the demand for electricity?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the decision variables are, for each period and each generation unit:\n",

    "* has the unit been switched on?\n",
    "* has the unit been switched off?\n",
    "* how much the unit produces?\n",

    "\n",
    "Decision Optimization is one of the existing techniques to perform Prescriptive analytics and to recommend actions that are based on desired outcomes and business constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Optimization problem-solving requires:\n",
    "* a **model**: some mathematical formulation of the business problem, where business constraints and objectives are expressed as mathematical statements,\n",
    "* some **input data** for the particular case to solve, including sound data and predicted data,\n",
    "* an optimization **engine** which will compute a solution for this input data and this optimization model formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to interact with the optimization engine, and solve different versions of the optimization problem.\n",
    "With these different insights, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes.  \n"
