    "This notebook illustrates how to solve an optimization model using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. \n",
    "It solves a generalized assignment problem (GAP), as defined by Wolsey, using this relaxation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim is to show multiple optimization through the modification of different models existing in a single environment, and not to show you how to solve a GAP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of Mathematical Programming, this technique consists of approximating a difficult constrained problem by a simpler problem: you remove difficult constraints by integrating them in the objective function, and penalizing it if the constraint is not respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method penalizes violations of inequality constraints using a Lagrange multiplier, which imposes a cost on violations. These added costs are used instead of the strict inequality constraints in the optimization. In practice, this relaxed problem can often be solved more easily than the original problem.\n",
    "\n",

    "Prescriptive analytics (decision optimization) technology recommends actions that are based on desired outcomes. It considers specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control over business outcomes.\n",

    "Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle a future situation. Organizations that act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.\n",
