A customer pays the price for that good or service.\n",

Not to provide a one size fits all pricing solution that works everywhere, but a general guide of data science techniques that are useful for pricing related problems.\n",

    "Another concept that is critical to understand is price discrimination. Let's say that two 22-year-old men walk into a convenience store off an old highway in rural West Texas to buy a bottle of water. This part of Texas is a desert. It is in the middle of July. The sun is hot, and rain is scarce. One of the men walking into the store drove to the store in a car with air conditioning. The second man walked three miles to get to the store. The man who walked to the store is likely to be thirstier than the man who drove, right? I could even say that the man who walked's demand curve for the bottle of water is higher than the man who drove his car. Even though the store owner knows this, he really can't charge the thirstier man more the water, even though the thirstier man would likely pay more. In other words, the store owner cannot price discriminate between the two customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Price discrimination is charging different prices to different customers based on their demand for your product. The more a firm can price discriminate, the higher their profits will be. There are books written on why this is so, but for now, understanding this basic fact is good enough. Be careful, though; sometimes, price discrimination is illegal. There are many situations where it is lawful, however. The airlines are masters of price discrimination. Historically, they separate consumers who book travel early versus those who book travel late. The earlier you book a flight, typically the cheaper the fare. Movie theaters that offer a senior discount also use price discrimination. They offer a lower price because seniors have a different demand curve than younger moviegoers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last economics concept to understand related to pricing is inflation. Inflation is the annual upward drift in pricing that occurs across an economy over time. If you've lived life, you have probably noticed that most things get a little more expensive each year. Another way to think of inflation is the change in the cost of living. In the United States, inflation has been pretty low over the last twenty years. Typically, the US inflation rate is estimated to be about 1% to 3% annually. Understanding inflation is essential because when we set prices in the real world, we must consider inflation. Usually, this means that price changes account for changes in inflation. For example, if you have a market that is prime for a price increase, you'll likely increase prices by inflation plus some percentage. If the inflation rate is 1.5%, you may decide to raise prices by inflation plus 5%. This means the actual change in prices is 6.5%. Likewise, if you want to decrease the price, you can hold it constant. If inflation is 1.5% and the price of your product remains unchanged year over year, essentially, this amounts to a 1.5% decrease in price. Think of it like this.\n",
    "If everything else in the economy increases in price by 1.5% and your product's price did not change, in relative or real terms, the price of your product is lower than it was the previous year.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's all relative, right? I remember when I was a kid, and all my friends were growing taller when I wasn't. I wasn't shrinking, but it sure felt like it.\n",

Some probably have an elasticity greater than .35. Others probably have an elasticity that is less than .35. In other words, if you increase prices by 3% across the board, on average, you will realize a 1.05% increase in revenue. This is an average. Some stores will recognize more than 1.05%, and others will discover less than 1.05%. A 3% increase in prices may even cause some stores to lose revenue.\n",

Tailoring each store's price increase based on their specific market will lead to an even more significant revenue increase. For example, you can raise prices by 3% on average and get an increase in revenue greater than 1.05%.\n",

    "This anomaly allows me to make an essential point about this data and all data observed outside of a laboratory. A friend of mine once said that using a sophisticated model on data from a corporate data warehouse is like using a laser beam to slice bologna. Nothing could be more accurate. We live in an imperfect world filled with random noise and random error. You have to remember this as you \"do\" your data science. Most of the time, your models' output is directional and subject to the imperfect world that we inhabit. That doesn't mean that the work we do as data scientists are not useful; it is. Just remember that the goal is to guide the business towards better revenue, lower costs, and higher profit. Perfection is a goal, not a destination. We are subject to an imperfect world, but data science can make it better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this, it makes me sometimes wonder about the emphasis on prediction accuracy that I've seen in the last few years. I mean, with the Kaggle competitions and the highly complex algorithms, are we really improving things? Does improving the accuracy from .1% to .01% matter? I mean, at the end of the day, aren't still just left with a sliced piece of bologna? Not always, but in many situations, I think you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now what do we do? That isn't easy to say. Moving from your Jupyter notebook to the real-world is never a straightforward task, especially given the limitations of our imperfect world. Having said that, given all the information presented so far, we can take action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things to keep in mind. One, history is essential. If the historical rate increase for a market is 1%, I wouldn't recommend implementing a 20% increase in prices. I would want to keep it consistent with what consumers are used to seeing. Two, listen to others in the organization, especially those in customer-facing roles. When it comes to antidote versus data, I am 100% in the data camp. Having said that, I don't think you can ignore those who are intimately connected to the business. For example, if a store manager is convinced his store cannot handle a price increase and your model says it is prime for one, I wouldn't go as big as I would if the store manager was indifferent or advocating strongly for a price increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how you can use our analysis to set price changes. We will assume that this firm increased prices for the last few years by the inflation rate across the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "For segment 4, price is below average, quantity is way above average, and the revenue elasticity is 0.72. I would increase prices by inflation + 4%. This should yield a 2.88% real increase in revenue for these stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "For segment 0, price is above average, quantity is above average, and the revenue elasticity is .59, I would increase prices by inflation + 2%. This would yield a 1.2 percent real increase in revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For segment 3, price is way below average, quantity is below average, and revenue elasticity is .48, I would increase prices by inflation + 1%. This should yield a .48% increase in real revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For segment 2, price is way above average, quantity is below average, and revenue elasticity is .45, I would increase prices by inflation + .5%. This should yield a .225% increase in real revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For segment 1, price is above average, quantity is below average, and revenue elasticity is .39, I would increase prices by inflation. This should yield a 0% increase in real revenue.\n",
    "\n",
