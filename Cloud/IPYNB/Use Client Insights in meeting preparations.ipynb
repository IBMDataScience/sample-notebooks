    "## Scenario\n",
    "Bruce Smith is a financial advisor servicing high net worth households in the Canadian market whose wealth is typically tied to the mining, natural gas, and petroleum industries. Most of his clients are senior executives working for one of two major large Anglo-Australian natural resources multinationals where Bruce has developed an extensive book of business based on personal referrals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Bruce is preparing for a meeting with his longtime client, Alex Anderson, who is relocating his wife Jane and their two children back to the Northwest Territories after a three-year international tour of duty. While the two have stayed in contact, it’s been some time since they’ve met in person.  Bruce wants to make sure he’s well prepared for this meeting in order to re-establish their personal connection and demonstrate the continuing value he’s able to deliver to the Anderson family through highly personalized service and advice to preserve their financial well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Bruce will typically receive insights to help him prepare for this meeting via an Advisor Desktop or CRM that has been pre-integrated with IBM Watson Client Insight for Wealth Management APIs by his parent firm, let’s take a look at how a Data Scientist or Developer interacting directly with these APIs might help Bruce prepare for his upcoming meeting with Alex and Jane."
