    "Benders decomposition is an approach to solve mathematical programming problems with a decomposable structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since V12.7, CPLEX can decompose the model into a single master and (possibly multiple) subproblems. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, CPLEX can use annotations that you supply for your model or can automatically do the decomposition. \n",
    "This approach can be applied to mixed-integer linear programs (MILP). For certain types of problems, this approach can offer significant performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "If your problem does not match such decomposition, CPLEX will raise an error at solve time.\n",
