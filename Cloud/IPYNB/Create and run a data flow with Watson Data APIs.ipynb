    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Use the IBM Watson Data Flows service to create and run data flows in a runtime engine. A flow can read data from a large variety of sources, process that data using pre-defined operations or custom code, and then write it to one or more targets. The runtime engine can handle large amounts of data so it's ideally suited for reading, processing, and writing data at volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sources and targets that are supported include both Cloud and on-premises offerings as well as data assets in projects. Cloud offerings include IBM Cloud Object Storage, Amazon S3, and Azure, among others. On-premises offerings include IBM Db2, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the steps and code to get you started with creating, running and debugging data flows using the Watson Data APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of the supported connectivity and the properties they support see [IBM Watson Data Flows Service - Data Asset and Connection Properties](https://api.dataplatform.ibm.com/v2/data_flows/doc/dataasset_and_connection_properties.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs on Python and Spark",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "This tutorial uses the [Customer demographics and sales](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/f8ccaf607372882403a37d9019b3abf4) data set. You can add this to your project from the tile in the [Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/community?context=analytics)."
