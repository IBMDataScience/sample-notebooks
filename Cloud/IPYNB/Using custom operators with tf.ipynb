    "In this notebook we learnt how to create a custom Python operation using TensorFlow's `tf.py_function` and used it on the LeNet model for MNIST.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned how to use the `watson-machine-learning-client` to store a library created to use the same operation into the WML Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we stored our custom LeNet model with references to the created library into WML Repository, and this model could be deployed and scored later using the WML Service."
