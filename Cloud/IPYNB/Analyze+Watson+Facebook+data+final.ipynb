    "# Analyze Facebook Data with IBM Watson services\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Python 3.5 notebook, you'll learn how to enrich and analyze a combined data set of unstructured and structured information with IBM Watson services. You'll analyze a standard Facebook Analytics export that includes photos and text from posts, articles, and thumbnails, plus standard performance metrics, such as likes, shares, and impressions. You'll visualize the results with PixieDust.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs on Python 3.5 with Spark 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part I**: Use the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding, Tone Analyzer, and Visual Recognition services to enrich the Facebook posts, thumbnails, and articles with image classification and these semantic features: emotion tones, social tones, language tones, entities, keywords, and document sentiment. The results of Part I will be features and metrics that you'll  visualize in Part III. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part II**: Create pandas DataFrames for the three main features: tone, keywords, and entities. You'll use these DataFrames to find insights with the visualizations in Part III.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part III**: Visualize the post consumption by tone, entity, and keyword with PixieDust.\n",
