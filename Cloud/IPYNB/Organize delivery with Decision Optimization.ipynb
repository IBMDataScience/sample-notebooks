    "* Each order consists of a given quantity of a product of a certain type.\n",
    "* A product type is an integer in {0, 1, 2}.\n",
    "* Loading the truck with at least one product of a given type requires some specific installations. \n",
    "* The truck can be configured in order to handle one, two or three different types of product. \n",
    "* There are 7 different configurations for the truck, corresponding to the 7 possible combinations of product types:\n",
    " - configuration 0: all products are of type 0,\n",
    " - configuration 1: all products are of type 1,\n",
    " - configuration 2: all products are of type 2,\n",
    " - configuration 3: products are of type 0 or 1,\n",
    " - configuration 4: products are of type 0 or 2,\n",
    " - configuration 5: products are of type 1 or 2,\n",
    " - configuration 6: products are of type 0 or 1 or 2.\n",
    "* The cost for configuring the truck from a configuration A to a configuration B depends on A and B.\n",
    "* The configuration of the truck determines its capacity and its loading cost.\n",
    "* A delivery consists of loading the truck with one or several orders for the same customer.\n",
    "* Both the cost (for configuring and loading the truck) and the number of deliveries needed to deliver all the orders must be minimized, the cost being the most important criterion.\n",

This insight can help your organization make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \n",
