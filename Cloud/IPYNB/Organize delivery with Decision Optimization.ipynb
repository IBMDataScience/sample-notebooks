    "* Each order consists of a given quantity of a product of a certain type.\n",
    "* A product type is an integer in {0, 1, 2}.\n",
    "* Loading the truck with at least one product of a given type requires some specific installations. \n",
    "* The truck can be configured in order to handle one, two or three different types of product. \n",
    "* There are 7 different configurations for the truck, corresponding to the 7 possible combinations of product types:\n",
    " - configuration 0: all products are of type 0,\n",
    " - configuration 1: all products are of type 1,\n",
    " - configuration 2: all products are of type 2,\n",
    " - configuration 3: products are of type 0 or 1,\n",
    " - configuration 4: products are of type 0 or 2,\n",
    " - configuration 5: products are of type 1 or 2,\n",
    " - configuration 6: products are of type 0 or 1 or 2.\n",
    "* The cost for configuring the truck from a configuration A to a configuration B depends on A and B.\n",
    "* The configuration of the truck determines its capacity and its loading cost.\n",
    "* A delivery consists of loading the truck with one or several orders for the same customer.\n",
    "* Both the cost (for configuring and loading the truck) and the number of deliveries needed to deliver all the orders must be minimized, the cost being the most important criterion.\n",
