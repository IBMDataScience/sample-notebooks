    "\n",
    "[Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) is a fast open-source engine for large-scale data processing. It is built for speed and ease of use. Through the advanced DAG execution engine that supports cyclic data flow and in-memory computing, programs can run up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10 times faster on disc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark consists of multiple components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spark Core is the underlying computation engine with the fundamental programming abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs)\n",
    "* Spark SQL provides a new data abstraction called DataFrames for structured data processing with SQL and domain-specific language\n",
    "* MLlib is a scalable machine learning framework for delivering fast distributed algorithms for mining big data\n",
    "* Streaming leverages Spark's fast scheduling capability to perform real-time analysis on streams of new data\n",
    "* GraphX is the graph processing framework for the analysis of graph structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample, you will focus on Spark Core and Spark SQL by using the Python API."
