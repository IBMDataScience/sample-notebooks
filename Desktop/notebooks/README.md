Use these sample notebooks to learn techniques for training and deploying machine learning models using the Python client and REST APIs. For example, learn how to:

- Import the Python client library and Watson Machine Learning client
- Authenticate with the IBM Watson Machine Learning Server
- Save a model to a deployment space on the Watson Machine Learning Sever
- Create a batch or online deployment
- Pass payload data to a modl and receive scoring data back
