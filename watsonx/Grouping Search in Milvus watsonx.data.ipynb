    "* Consider a collection of products, each product has various reviews.\n",
    "* Each review is represented by one vector embedding and belongs to one product.\n",
    "* To find relevant products instead of similar reviews, you can include the group_by_field argument in the search() operation to group results by the ProductId.\n",
    "* This helps return the most relevant and unique products, rather than separate reviews from the same product.\n",
